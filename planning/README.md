Keeping a dive log is a crucial part of any serious diver's routine.  The log – traditionally taking the form of a pad-and-pen binder or notebook – keeps track of crucial details like how much weight the diver used, his/her time at the bottom, tracks repair notes and equipment issues, and provides a record of milestones that can be crucial as the diver advances in his or her underwater career.
