## Background Summary

Keeping a dive log is a crucial part of any serious diver's routine.  The log – traditionally taking the form of a pad-and-pen binder or notebook – keeps track of crucial details like how much weight the diver used, his/her time at the bottom, tracks repair notes and equipment issues, and provides a record of milestones that can be crucial as the diver advances in his or her underwater career.  It also allows for your other divers and/or dive shops to vouch that a dive is legitimate, proving the diver's expertise when he or she seeks advanced training. See more about the <a href="https://www2.padi.com/blog/2015/05/07/why-keeping-a-logbook-will-help-make-you-a-better-diver/">importance of logging on PADI's website</a>.

However, keeping track of a physical notebook can be tedious, especially for diver's who travel around the world.  Similarly, more casual divers (those who only dive a few times a year) may risk misplacing their book between sessions.  A simple electronic implementation of a dive book can overcome these annoyances, while allowing for helpful data analysis and visualization across dives that isn't readily available in a physical log book.  

Extending the idea further, the app could make API calls to weather services to pre-fill information such as surface weather and/or wave conditions.
